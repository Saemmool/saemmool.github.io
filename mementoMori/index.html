                    When I was seven, my dad asked me to get a bottle of water from a well in our neighborhood.
                    I went to the well and tried to fill water to my bottle - but the water was too far from my short arms.
                    I slowly put myself into the well so that my bottle get close to water, but suddenly I fell into the well.</p>

                    I lost my consciousness, and brought to a hospital.

                    It was scary to face death alone in unexpected moment.
                    I was filled with anguish, because I didn't know what would happen to my spirit after death.
                    I read many religious books and listened to the speeches from religious leaders expecting that they would give me an answer.
                    However, those did not provide any answers to me.</p>

                        What if the words in Bible are truth? What if I fall into the hell after I die, even I didn't believe in the world after death?

                    When I was seven, my dad asked me to get a bottle of water from a well in our neighborhood.
                    I went to the well and tried to fill water to my bottle - but the water was too far from my short arms.
                    I slowly put myself into the well so that my bottle get close to water, but suddenly I fell into the well.</p>

                    That was the first experience of facing that, that I remember.</p>

                    When I was in high school, I got gas poioning from coal briquettes while sleeping.
                    I lost my consciousness, and brought to a hospital.
                    Since then, I seriously thought about my life, spirit and death.</p>

                    <p>
                    It was scary to face death alone in unexpected moment.
                    I was filled with anguish, because I didn't know what would happen to my spirit after death.
                    I read many religious books and listened to the speeches from religious leaders expecting that they would give me an answer.
                    However, those did not provide any answers to me.</p>

                        If I leave this world in my 10s or 20s by accident, what does my life mean that I lived until then? 
                        Who would care if such a small man disappear? 
                        People in this world woud be busy for their lives, and the lives would go on.

                        According to Bible, the death came in due to our sins.
                        There, my concern began: I couldn't deny that I had sins, though I didn't believe in Bible or Jesus at that time.
                        What if the words in Bible are truth? What if I fall into the hell after I die, even I didn't believe in the world after death?

                        Fortunately, everyone knows that we will die someday.
                        There is a saying that the four sufferings of life are 'being born, getting old, getting sick, and dying.'
                        Among them, the biggest issue was death.

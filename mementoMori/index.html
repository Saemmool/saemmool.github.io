                    When I was seven, my dad asked me to get a bottle of water from a well in our neighborhood.<br>
                    I went to the well and tried to fill water to my bottle - but the water was too far from my short arms.<br>
                    I slowly put myself into the well so that my bottle get close to water, but suddenly I fell into the well.</p>

                    That was the first experience of facing that, that I remember.</p>

                    When I was in high school, I got gas poioning from coal briquettes while sleeping.<br>
                    I lost my consciousness, and brought to a hospital.<br>
                    Since then, I seriously thought about my life, spirit and death.</p>

                    <p>
                    It was scary to face death alon in a moment that I cannot expect.<br>
                    I was filled with anguish, because I didn't know what would happen to my spirit after death.<br>
                    I read many religious books and listened to the speeches from religious leaders expecting that they would give me an answer.<br>
                    However, those did not provide any answers to me.</p>

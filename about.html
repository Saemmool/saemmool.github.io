                    <h3>I started my career as a journalist.</h3>
                    <p>I was fascinated by journalism in 2010, when I interned at The Dong-A Ilbo, where became my full-time employer a year later.
                        I loved exploring the society covering important issues, meeting interesting people, and writing stories under a tight deadline.
                        I covered a wide range of beats from crimes, health, and business. One of my favorite topics was immigration, which had full of complexities and dilemmas.
                        I realized that I love to tackle difficult issues that no one would easily figure out the solutions.

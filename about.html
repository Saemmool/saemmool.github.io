					<h1>My Story</h1>
					<div class="storybox">
						<h3>I started my career as a journalist.</h3>
						<p>
							I was fascinated by journalism in 2010, when I interned at
							<a href="https://www.donga.com/en/Docs">The Dong-A Ilbo</a>, where
							became my full-time employer a year later. I loved exploring the
							society covering important issues, meeting interesting people, and
							writing stories under a tight deadline. I covered a wide range of
							beats from crimes, health, and business. One of my favorite topics
							was immigration, which had full of complexities and dilemmas. I
							realized that I love to tackle difficult issues that no one would
							easily figure out the solutions.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="storybox">
						<h3>I crossed borders and moved on.</h3>
						<p>
							In the middle of my career, I moved to the Bay Area to study
							multimedia storytelling at
							<a href="https://journalism.berkeley.edu/"
								>UC Berkeley Graduate School of Journalism</a
							>, where I earned my master's degree('19). I produced multimedia
							news packages combining multiple components including video, data
							visualization, and photography. Coding was a big part of the
							projects, and it changed my life since then. I fell into codes
							that enable every imagination possible, require endless learning,
							and bring eye-opening user experience.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="storybox">
						<h3>I have been designing user experience.</h3>
						<p>
							After coming back to Seoul, I designed user experience for various
							projects. I led flagship multimedia projects listed in
							<a href="https://original.donga.com/">The Original</a>. The
							projects won various prizes including the Grand Prize of the
							Digital Journalism Awards in Korea. I also designed UX/UI of a new
							CMS(Content Management System) for our newsroom, which required
							complicated and detailed systematic approach. Now I manage the
							projects in a leadership position with the understanding on news,
							design and technology.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="storybox">
						<h3>I'm fluent in multiple languages.</h3>
						<p>
							I write professionally both in Korean and English. I worked as a
							writing assistant at
							<a href="https://citris-uc.org/"
								>CITRIS and the Banatao Institute</a
							>
							where I produced news stories for the organization's website and
							newsletters, and I have authored six books in Korean. In addition
							to that, I believe that design and technology are also "languages"
							that make people communicate. I'm proud that I speak those.
